<h4>Portugal won the European Championship in 2016, which was their first major title.
They also won the UEFA Nations League in 2019, and again in 2025 after defeating Spain in the final.
In the World Cup of 1966, they finished in third place, which remains their best result.
Portugal is now known as one of Europe’s strongest football teams, led by famous players like Cristiano Ronaldo.</h4>
